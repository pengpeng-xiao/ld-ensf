# Quantum DeepONet: Neural operators accelerated by quantum computing

The data and code for the paper *Xiao, P., Si, P., and Chen, P. LD-EnSF: Synergizing latent dynamics with ensemble score filters for fast data assimilation with sparse observations. The Fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2026.*

## Datasets

Data generation scripts are available in the [data](data) folder:

- [Antiderivative](data/ode_generation.py)
- [Poisson's equation](data/poisson_generation.py)
- [Advection equation](data/advection_generation.py)
- [Burgers equation](data/burgers_generation.py)

Each script generates training and testing data for the respective problem.

## Code

All code is in the folder [src](src). The code depends on the deep learning package [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde) v1.10.1. 

To install dependencies: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To train a model for a specific task, navigate to the corresponding example directory and run:

```bash
python training.py
```

After training, simulate the trained quantum DeepONet using [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit). The simulation scripts are located in the same folder as the training code. To run the simulation, use:

```bash
python simulation.py
```
> *Note: Some tasks may use different script names for simulation; please check the example folder for details.*
